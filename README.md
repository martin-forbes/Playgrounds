# Playgrounds
Play area for all KempaLab members - have a look around and make yourself familiar with git, github and RStudio. Don't be afraid - there is hardly a way to break anything. 

Use this repository and experiment online using the web browser or RStudio. My suggestion - start with the little tasks below.

## Little tasks
### Task 1 - peep
* Add your name to this document in the section KempaLab member peeps - just works a short confirmation that you've received the invitation to the KempaLab organisation.

### Task 2 - Clone repo
* Clone this repository to your computer with RStudio. 
* use the green button, copy the link, new Rproject with version control

### Task 3 - PersonalFolder
* Create a new folder (name - e.g. Guidos_playground) inside this local repository. 
* Add a file of your choice (e.g., some R code, a R markdown file)
* Create a commit (`git status`, `git add`, `git commit -m "message"`)
* Push your commit upstream, meaning to the remote repository with `git push -u origin master`

There is no need to create a new branch for this task, we just keep it simple here. The same holds true for the content of the file. If you are not sure what to do - Create a new R markdown file and change the content of the template file. Take your time to play with markdown syntax.

Check online if your folder and file appeared in the repo

### Task 4 - `git pull`
Check for any updates of the repository with `git pull`. Check what did change in your local repository.

## Cheat sheets
The following summaries are very helpful to take a glimpse on R markdown, git and other famous R packages. Feel free to add further useful slides or posts.
